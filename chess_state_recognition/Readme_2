This repository is a copy from sta314's repository, which is fully functioning, 
well written and well documented. The modified version here can be used for 
chess board corner detection only. Detection is achieved with conventional 
Image processing techniques (Open Cv, Canny Edge Detection and 
Hough Line Transformation in a rather complicated and slow pipeline. 

The corner coordinates are saved in a file for later use in the Chess Game Tracker Setup. 
Program parts concerning piece detection with Yolo were deactivated.
